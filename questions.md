```

**5. Kindly describe what is meant by explicit and implicit data conversion.**

An implicit conversion does not require any special syntax in the source code. An explicit conversion uses a type conversion keyword.



**6. Give an example of how to use template literals with interpolation. (using code snippet Markdown üëÜüèΩ).**

```javascript
const me = {

state: "Missouri",

bands: {
  progMetal: "Chon",
	folk: "John Prine",
	rock: "The Struts"

**9. When working from the command line, we can combine commands with ______s and _____s, if needed.**

**10. Compare and contrast JSON with JS *objects.* Go back and look inside 'package.json,' for example and compare that to the *objects* we have been creating.**

With JS Objects,

- We don't have to put quotation marks around our keys because no matter what JS will expect those to be strings.

With JSON
- We must always put those quotation marks around each and every key.
